There are 2 different types of Eid that Muslims celebrate:Eid al'fitr and Eid al'adha.
Eid al'fitr marks the end of Ramadan [the fasting period]

Eid al'adha marks the end of the Hajj period and also commemorates the time the Prophet Ibrahim was willing to sacrifice his son but instead ended up sacrificing a ram.
this is why Muslims do something called "qurbani" which is where they sacrifice an animal the same way the prophet did.
